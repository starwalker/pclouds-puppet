pclouds-ebsvol

Please see http://www.practicalclouds.com/content/guide/custom-puppet-type-ebsvol for more information.

This module allow you to manage Amazon ebs volumes, by creating, destroying, or attaching them to EC2 instances. 
NOTE: It requires the fog rubygem to be installed and access keyxes with enough priviledges to create, destroy and attach ebsvolumes in ~/.fog configured.

e.g.

ebsvol {
  'tester1':
	size => 1,
  	availability_zone => 'eu-west-1a',
	ensure => present,
}
ebsvol {
	'tester2':
	ensure => absent,
}

The EBSVol provider also allows you to attach an EBS volume to an EC2 instance specified by its Name tag or the
special name "me" which attached it to the EC2 instance performing the puppet run.  If you are attaching a volume
to an instance then you MUST include the 'device' which you want to attach to. e.g.

ebsvol {
  'tester1':
	size => 1,
  	availability_zone => 'eu-west-1a',
	ensure => present,
	attached_to => 'me',
	device => '/dev/sdb',
}

NOTE: A volume MUST be in the same availability zone as an EC2 instance in order to be able to attach to it.

Once a volume is attached to an instance, it still needs a file system and mounting, which will be handled by other puppet modules.
