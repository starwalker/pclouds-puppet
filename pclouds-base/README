pclouds-base

This is the pclouds-base module, which ensures that the base packages are added to the system.

Specifically it: -

1. Formats as ext4 and mounts the epthemeral disk to /data
2. Sets the time zone based on the amazon region.
3. Installs VIM and yum fastmirror plugin.
4. Installs Ruby, ruby gems. gcc and make etc and installs the fog rubygem for accessing cloud services.

It also includes an ebsvol type and provider which allow you to create, destroy and attach aws ebs volumes
to your running EC2 instances.  The name of your EBS volume is set as a Name tag so that you can work
with nanes that mean something to you and you can predict, such as "MyDrupalDatabase" rather than vol-ebcdbb83
which is allocated by Amazon at creatation as an identifier.

e.g.

ebsvol {
  'tester1':
	size => 1,
  availability_zone => 'eu-west-1a',
	ensure => present,
}
ebsvol {
	'tester2':
	ensure => absent,
}

The EBSVol provider also allows you to attach an EBS volume to an EC2 instance specified by its Name tag or the
special name "me" which attached it to the EC2 instance performing the puppet run.  If you are attaching a volume
to an instance then you MUST include the 'device' which you want to attach to. e.g.

ebsvol {
  'tester1':
	size => 1,
  availability_zone => 'eu-west-1a',
	ensure => present,
	attached_to => 'me',
	device => '/dev/sdb',
}
